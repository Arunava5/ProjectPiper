A program for textfile compression (by Huffman Coding).

Inspired by the popular English TV Series "Silicon Valley".

Developed and tested in my 6th Semester in college.

On an average it achieves a compression ratio of around 1.5 ,
where compression ratio is the ratio of the file sizes of the uncompressed and the compressed file.


Possible improvements for future : Extending the compressing ability to files of other extensions as well (possibly music and videos).
